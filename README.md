# HR-Resource-Query-Chatbot
The HR Resource Query Chatbot is an AI-powered application that helps HR teams quickly find employees based on skills, experience, and availability. It uses a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline: employee data is embedded into a vector index for semantic search, and a language model formats human-readable responses.
